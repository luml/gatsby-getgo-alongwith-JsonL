###### I really enjoy working from home and not to work at all.

## This is crazy, I know.

After a week staying at home working from home, it's like feeling time is stuck at here. Of course there's no such work to do since CNY holiday is just over.
I bet if you were me, you will miss any day that is sunny and warm and you can actually go out and have a nice walk, maybe go with a kind date. When it just began, I kinda felt released, cus you know finally there's a chance you don't need to catch the darn subway.
Luckily, I have roommates and they are my good friends. We're all sort of gregarious and charismatic, I think. There's only one nice desk in our living room. So I did this interesting photo in favour of having an excuse to not share the desk most time. Hope my friends won't see this post.
Tried my best being a jerk, i'm kidding.
