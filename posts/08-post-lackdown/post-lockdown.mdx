###### First thing I did after such long-time lockdown

The news came out, no more limitation!!! Right before Labour day Holiday, you got be kidding me. You have no idea how I pumped up immediately.
I would never say someday I will catch the travel bug, but the very first thing I did is buy round-trip ticket for a sweet travel.
Not every trip can be delightful, ofc this time will be a relief. No man can survive, I mean keep mentally healthy after a very long time under control.
Even through it was for good.

##### When we're back, things will be the same, as always. I will get bored as usual.
