###### I don't have the guts to cut something off my life

Some part of inside, I don't feel I can take the bordom all by myself. But I guess I have to, right now the only thing I should do is stop asking for more, and what I really wanna do is being honest and make communication possible.
After the communication, i see things much clearly. Sometimes it's not all about you. People make mistakes all the time, what matters is we learn from how we fall.

#### ðŸ”ˆAnd be kind, think good for others.
