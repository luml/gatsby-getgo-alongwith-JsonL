###### I don't have the guts to cut something off my life

Some part of inside, I don't feel I can take the burden all by myself. But I guess I have to, right now the only thing I should do is stop asking for more, and what I really wanna do is being honest and make communication possible.
After the communication, I see things much clearly. Sometimes it's not all about you. People make mistakes all the time, what matters is we learn from how we fall. When it's the time to apologize, I apologize.

#### üîàAnd be kind, think good for others.

#### ‚è≥LESS ME, LESS STRESS
