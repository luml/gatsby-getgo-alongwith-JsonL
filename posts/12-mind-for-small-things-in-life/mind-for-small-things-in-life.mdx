###### To have a mind for small things going on in our lives

I found this book my friend's 5-year-old son reads. He reads the whole book almost correctly with English.
I was a little bit touched by the last sentance of that book.

#### " I love you right up to the moon "

#### " and back "

###### I read it again, such a short small and pleasant book for kids.

The very inspiring thing I learned from the book is expressing your feelings when you want to let someone know how you feel about them. Even it's tiny, it will make one's day.
Don't be too shy when it's time to be real.
