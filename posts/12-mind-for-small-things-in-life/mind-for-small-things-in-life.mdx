###### To have a mind for small things going on in our life

I found this book my friend's 5 years old son reads. He reads the whole book almost correctly.
I was a little bit touched by the last sentance of that book.

#### " I love you right up to the moon "

#### " and back "

###### I read it again, such a short small and pleasant book for kids.

The very inspiring thing I learned from the book is expressing your feelings when you want to let someone know how you feel about them.
