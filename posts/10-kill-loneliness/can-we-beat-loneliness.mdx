###### How come from now and then I really feel alone...

Even in the most overcrowded circle, someone must be left alone inside. I am a wanter, most of us are too. From my perspective, this is the one reason why we feel lonely.
I want a close friend, but no crap talks. This is impossible. Friends are well known for gossip.
I need a active community with cool people, but most of time I judge them over some pieces.
I attend a speech competition, after few days I got an email with darn rejection.
I try to jump ship, now I'm still doing the same job as boring as always.
I try to learn algorithm, not it's too darn difficult for me.
I try to write some words beautiful, but what you might read right now. Yaks
Also does this picture match the headline, doesn't it ?

##### The anwser for the head question seems not really becasue of literally being alone.

OMG is everything must be this tough ?
