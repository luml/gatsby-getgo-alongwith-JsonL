###### Never got caught by the title of mine.

### I knew myself could be much attached to things that are beyond control. The mindset and thoughts of one person needs to be appreciated by another.
### That's one kind of humanity. Two people get along because of that, two people don't that might be leading to fall apart.
### After the mistake everyone have make or will make, unfortunately I did. I'm more clear and thanksful for the newly venture I'm stepping on these days.
### So, I got lucky this time, maybe because I deserve it.
