###### No surprise to see your friends leave eventually

First of all, this post title isn't about playing the field at all. I meant people. Peopele who care less.

#### 🛬They came

---

🥊 they said hey

🍒 they smiled to you

🥨 they lied to you

🍻 they made you laugh

---

#### They left 🛫

Peopele you met is who you chose to meet. No surprise they don't leave the foot print, they leave scar.
