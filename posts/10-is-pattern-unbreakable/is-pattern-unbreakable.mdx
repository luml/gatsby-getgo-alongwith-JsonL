###### I recently found I coundn't get rid of my own pattern.

First, my little pattern is nostalgia which I can put it in there two aspects.
And I tell you next time, so I might still have a chance to break it.

##### Maybe having a certain pattern is a good thing, it helps you know yourself better. In my case, I learned some knowledge I call it emotion-attached.

##### ðŸŸ¢ First One:
Something came up, I get attached immediately. Something finally ended, I still get attached for a very long time.
Then something suddenly came up again, heck know what I will do.I hope I do nothing but something interesting.

##### I get it from a long time ago. It isn't just my own pattern unbreakable. It's just too late when I finally knew it.

##### ðŸŸ¢Second One:
Everytime I want to jump ship, then I failed because of several times failure or just because of my dignity. This year 2020 sucks by far. If this pattern will last forever, I'll be totally doomed.

Last but not least, I know never give up hope.
