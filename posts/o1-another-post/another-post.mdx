###### This is my next blog right in 2020.

## This is my neighbourhood, I took this special picture cus it was first snow at here.

Right at the end of 2019, I decided to pick up a new design skill, so before I can actually design something which it's maybe better to learn how to use Photoshop from adobe. After I practice along with the offical tutrial course, I tried to make some new pictures from my own. So here it is, nevertheless, this is smart idea to get started. In the very soon future, I hope can bring up more creative and original workpieces.
