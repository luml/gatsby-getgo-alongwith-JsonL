###### I'm so grateful that my new trainer helps me doing my workout that early. I got up at 5:30 today, I felt full of energy now.

Working out in the morning is my dream. because when you have a full time job and don't have a flexible gym in your area.
It's impossible to be able to do lifting-weight at 6am. Now I'm more believe that anything is possible.

Below here came along next day. It was a leg day, I started at 6am. It wasn't very tough, I think it's a good start to not reach the limit in the beginning because leg-day is more diffcult than others.
The bad news is I have to do some overtime today, it's on weekend, I know. Sometimes I really don't have choices. But I started today really nice by breaking pattern.
