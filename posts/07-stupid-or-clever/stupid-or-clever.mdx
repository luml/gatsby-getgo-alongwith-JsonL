###### No matter what happens...

## Wish I knew it ASAP

About this month, I tried something which I have never done in my whole life Z🥊. These days I couldn't shake some thoughts off my mind.
It happened in an unexpected timeing and space. Maybe it is because I spent a whole week working from home, and I got very bored.
It was certainly not 🅰️ mistake, I don't fall for that kind of mistake, but for long-term it could be. Each journey is unique, is this one too?
I made so much judgment in the past, this time i won't let c...🇬🇧...hance fade out again.
Anyway, considering last year I also got lucky in Feb, so I would suggest that every February is my lucky month in every following year.
❗️H❗️ere we go.

###### Ok, the content below came from few days later. I'm not a diary person, but I certainly did some writing work to figure out what's going on these days. Then I finally got this.

###### From my own quote: I’m try to be smart enough as much as I can and I don’t wanna be a stupid one who couldn't sense the situation.

#### That is I got bored easily as last time. Sometimes people know themself in deep. Relationship can be hard, neither you admit nor reject it. You will never know what you feel about a certain thing or what you want from someone until you tries something new and did something wrong. Unless you pick up the guts to fight for it.
