###### Happy year of the rat.

## This is the most special festival in China, this year it may be more special.

It seems the chinese new year is getting less and less important for new generation as much as I can see. Chunyun period is such a pain for everyone far away their hometown.
I can't be on behalf of anybody, but I'd admit I hat Chinese New Year travel period. And, it's like forever, after the short sweet happy family reunion time, it's absoluty hard to snag a ticket to go back to work.
Plus, China is fighting with a novel coronavirus. There's no doult it's urgent.
Suffice to say, happy Chinese New Year for everyone 🎊🐭
