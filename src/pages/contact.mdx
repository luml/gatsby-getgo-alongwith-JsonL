# Contact Me

You can get in touch with me by opening the nearest window and yelling out of it real loud.
Because I live in far far away in Beijing, China.

## Or you can wave to me, I mean email me...

Just click this button to simulate a friendly wave.

<Wave />

Please note that I may not wave back. This is because I am very far away and probably didnâ€™t see you click this button.

# _Have a nice one ðŸ’š_
